This is a repository of Monte Carlo Simulations.  The first one is a simulation implemented in C# .net and aims to answer the following question:

A population starts with a single amoeba. For this one and for the generations thereafter, there is a probability of 3/4 that an individual amoeba will split to create two amoebas, and a 1/4 probability that it will die out without producing offspring. What is the probability that the family tree of the original amoeba will go on forever?

The first commit is aimed at answering a variation of the above question.  The variation is 1/3 ameba dies, 1/3 ameba splits into two, 1/3 the ameba splits into three.
